  <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
  <div class="lesson">
    <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of Web and HTML</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">WWW(World Wide Web)</div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p> is an information system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet and built on top of the Domain Name System.[1] It has also commonly become known simply as the Web. Individual document pages on the World Wide Web are called web pages and are accessed with a software application running on the user's computer, commonly called a web browser. Web pages may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia components, as well as web navigation features consisting of hyperlinks.</p></div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</div>
        <div class="concept-description"><p> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like html). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like and, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

<p>Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</p></div>
        <div class="concept">
          <div class="concept-title">Tags</div>
          <div class="concept-description"><p>are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. You can determine the closing tag because it has a slash.</p></div>
          <div class="concept">
            <div class="concept-title">Why computers are stupid?</div>
            <div class="concept-description"><p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p></div>

    <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">Developer Tools(Browser)</div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p>allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and IDEs in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user facing interface of a website or web application.

Web development tools come as browser add-ons or built in features in web browsers. The most popular web browsers today like, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari have built in tools to help web developers, and many additional add-ons can be found in their respective plugin download centers.

Web development tools allow developers to work with a variety of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, the DOM, JavaScript, and other components that are handled by the web browser. Due to the increasing demand from web browsers to do more popular web browsers have included more features geared for developers.</p></div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">The "tree-like" structure of HTML</div>
        <div class="concept-description"><p>The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... </p></div>
        <div class="concept">
          <div class="concept-title">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</div>
          <div class="concept-description"><p>When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p></div>
          <div class="concept">
            <div class="concept-title">Text Editor for Programming</div>
            <div class="concept-description"><p>A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Text editors are often provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code. </p></div>

    <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">CSS(Cascading StyleSheet)</div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p> is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p></div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Understanding CSS</div>
        <div class="concept-description"><p>Using CSS styles to format a page separates content from presentation. The content of your page—the HTML code—resides in the HTML file, and the CSS rules defining the presentation of the code reside in another file an external style sheet or in another part of the HTML document usually the head section. Separating content from presentation makes it much easier to maintain the appearance of your site from a central location because you don't need to update every property on every page whenever you want to make a change. Separating content from presentation also results in simpler and cleaner HTML code, which provides shorter browser loading times, and simplifies navigation for people with accessibility issues for example, those using screen readers.

CSS gives you great flexibility and control over the exact appearance of your page. With CSS you can control many text properties including specific fonts and font sizes; bold, italics, underlining, and text shadows; text color and background color; link color and link underlining; and much more. By using CSS to control your fonts, you can also ensure a more consistent treatment of your page layout and appearance in multiple browsers.</p></div>

    <h1>Reflection & Others</h1>
    <div class="concept-title">Summary</div>
      <div class="concept-description"><p><b>WWW</b> - it is an information system on the Internet that allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.</p>
        <p><b>HTML</b> - a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.</p>
        <p><b>Developer Tools(browser)</b> - HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an <em>"invisible box"</em> around the content inside of them. </p>
        <p><b>CSS</b> - is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. </p></div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">My Reflection</div>
        <div class="concept-description"><p>It took me 4 days before I finished Lesson 3(Adding CSS and HTML Structure) but I am so glad that i understand everything in the lesson now. I feel so comfortable when I finished a lesson and I know how things works. Few weeks ago, I don't even know how the tags works, now I can't believe that I'm at CSS now. Udacity teaches clearly and has more information than universities. I am so glad that I am studying here at Udacity. I already learned so many in Programming. Thank you!</p></div><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="my picture">
